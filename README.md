This repository contains code for a simple movie recommendation system using Python and scikit-learn.

Overview
The movie_recommendation.ipynb notebook demonstrates how to:
Load a dataset of movies (dataset.csv).
Preprocess the data by combining relevant columns and removing unnecessary ones.
Use CountVectorizer to convert text data into numerical vectors.
Compute cosine similarity between movies based on their tags.
Implement a function to recommend movies based on user input.

Requirements
Python 3.x
pandas
scikit-learn

Usage
Ensure you have the required Python packages installed.
Run the code in movie_recommendation.ipynb using Jupyter Notebook or any compatible environment.
Follow the instructions in the notebook to load the dataset, preprocess the data, and recommend movies.

Files
dataset.csv: Contains movie data.
